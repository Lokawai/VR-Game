## [1.0.2] - 2022-09-12

- Fixed issue where `NetworkTransform` was not honoring the InLocalSpace property on the authority side during OnNetworkSpawn. (#2170)
- Fixed issue where `NetworkTransform` was not ending extrapolation for the previous state causing non-authoritative instances to become out of synch. (#2170)
- Fixed issue where `NetworkTransform` was not continuing to interpolate for the remainder of the associated tick period. (#2170)
- Fixed issue during `NetworkTransform.OnNetworkSpawn` for non-authoritative instances where it was initializing interpolators with the replicated network state which now only contains the transform deltas that occurred during a network tick and not the entire transform state. (#2170)

## [1.0.1] - 2022-08-23

### Changed

- Changed version to 1.0.1. (#2131)
- Updated dependency on `com.unity.transport` to 1.2.0. (#2129)
- When using `UnityTransport`, _reliable_ payloads are now allowed to exceed the configured 'Max Payload Size'. Unreliable payloads remain bounded by this setting. (#2081)
- Performance improvements for cases with large number of NetworkObjects, by not iterating over all unchanged NetworkObjects 

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue where reading/writing more than 8 bits at a time with BitReader/BitWriter would write/read from the wrong place, returning and incorrect result. (#2130)
- Fixed issue with the internal `NetworkTransformState.m_Bitset` flag not getting cleared upon the next tick advancement. (#2110)
- Fixed interpolation issue with `NetworkTransform.Teleport`. (#2110)
- Fixed issue where the authoritative side was interpolating its transform. (#2110)
- Fixed Owner-written NetworkVariable infinitely write themselves (#2109)
- Fixed NetworkList issue that showed when inserting at the very end of a NetworkList (#2099)
- Fixed issue where a client owner of a `NetworkVariable` with both owner read and write permissions would not update the server side when changed. (#2097)
- Fixed issue when attempting to spawn a parent `GameObject`, with `NetworkObject` component attached, that has one or more child `GameObject`s, that are inactive in the hierarchy, with `NetworkBehaviour` components it will no longer attempt to spawn the associated `NetworkBehaviour`(s) or invoke ownership changed notifications but will log a warning message. (#2096)
- Fixed an issue where destroying a NetworkBehaviour would not deregister it from the parent NetworkObject, leading to exceptions when the parent was later destroyed. (#2091)
- Fixed issue where `NetworkObject.NetworkHide` was despawning and destroying, as opposed to only despawning, in-scene placed `NetworkObject`s. (#2086)
- Fixed `NetworkAnimator` synchronizing transitions twice due to it detecting the change in animation state once a transition is started by a trigger. (#2084)
- Fixed issue where `NetworkAnimator` would not synchronize a looping animation for late joining clients if it was at the very end of its loop. (#2076)
- Fixed issue where `NetworkAnimator` was not removing its subscription from `OnClientConnectedCallback` when despawned during the shutdown sequence. (#2074)
- Fixed IsServer and IsClient being set to false before object despawn during the shutdown sequence. (#2074)
- Fixed NetworkList Value event on the server. PreviousValue is now set correctly when a new value is set through property setter. (#2067)
- Fixed NetworkLists not populating on client. NetworkList now uses the most recent list as opposed to the list at the end of previous frame, when sending full updates to dynamically spawned NetworkObject. The difference in behaviour is required as scene management spawns those objects at a different time in the frame, relative to updates. (#2062)

## [1.0.0] - 2022-06-27

### Changed

- Changed version to 1.0.0. (#2046)

## [1.0.0-pre.10] - 2022-06-21

### Added

- Added a new `OnTransportFailure` callback to `NetworkManager`. This callback is invoked when the manager's `NetworkTransport` encounters an unrecoverable error. Transport failures also cause the `NetworkManager` to shut down. Currently, this is only used by `UnityTransport` to signal a timeout of its connection to the Unity Relay servers. (#1994)
- Added `NetworkEvent.TransportFailure`, which can be used by implementations of `NetworkTransport` to signal to `NetworkManager` that an unrecoverable error was encountered. (#1994)
- Added test to ensure a warning occurs when nesting NetworkObjects in a NetworkPrefab (#1969)
- Added `NetworkManager.RemoveNetworkPrefab(...)` to remove a prefab from the prefabs list (#1950)

### Changed

- Updated `UnityTransport` dependency on `com.unity.transport` to 1.1.0. (#2025)
- (API Breaking) `ConnectionApprovalCallback` is no longer an `event` and will not allow more than 1 handler registered at a time. Also, `ConnectionApprovalCallback` is now an `Action<>` taking a `ConnectionApprovalRequest` and a `ConnectionApprovalResponse` that the client code must fill (#1972) (#2002)

### Removed

### Fixed
- Fixed issue where dynamically spawned `NetworkObject`s could throw an exception if the scene of origin handle was zero (0) and the `NetworkObject` was already spawned. (#2017)
- Fixed issue where `NetworkObject.Observers` was not being cleared when despawned. (#2009)
- Fixed `NetworkAnimator` could not run in the server authoritative mode. (#2003)
- Fixed issue where late joining clients would get a soft synchronization error if any in-scene placed NetworkObjects were parented under another `NetworkObject`. (#1985)
- Fixed issue where `NetworkBehaviourReference` would throw a type cast exception if using `NetworkBehaviourReference.TryGet` and the component type was not found. (#1984)
- Fixed `NetworkSceneManager` was not sending scene event notifications for the currently active scene and any additively loaded scenes when loading a new scene in `LoadSceneMode.Single` mode. (#1975)
- Fixed issue where one or more clients disconnecting during a scene event would cause `LoadEventCompleted` or `UnloadEventCompleted` to wait until the `NetworkConfig.LoadSceneTimeOut` period before being triggered. (#1973)
- Fixed issues when multiple `ConnectionApprovalCallback`s were registered (#1972)
- Fixed a regression in serialization support: `FixedString`, `Vector2Int`, and `Vector3Int` types can now be used in NetworkVariables and RPCs again without requiring a `ForceNetworkSerializeByMemcpy<>` wrapper. (#1961)
- Fixed generic types that inherit from NetworkBehaviour causing crashes at compile time. (#1976)
- Fixed endless dialog boxes when adding a `NetworkBehaviour` to a `NetworkManager` or vice-versa. (#1947)
- Fixed `NetworkAnimator` issue where it was only synchronizing parameters if the layer or state changed or was transitioning between states. (#1946)
- Fixed `NetworkAnimator` issue where when it did detect a parameter had changed it would send all parameters as opposed to only the parameters that changed. (#1946)
- Fixed `NetworkAnimator` issue where it was not always disposing the `NativeArray` that is allocated when spawned. (#1946)
- Fixed `NetworkAnimator` issue where it was not taking the animation speed or state speed multiplier into consideration. (#1946)
- Fixed `NetworkAnimator` issue where it was not properly synchronizing late joining clients if they joined while `Animator` was transitioning between states. (#1946)
- Fixed `NetworkAnimator` issue where the server was not relaying changes to non-owner clients when a client was the owner. (#1946)
- Fixed issue where the `PacketLoss` metric for tools would return the packet loss over a connection lifetime instead of a single frame. (#2004)

## [1.0.0-pre.9] - 2022-05-10

### Fixed

- Fixed Hosting again after failing to host now works correctly (#1938)
- Fixed NetworkManager to cleanup connected client lists after stopping (#1945)
- Fixed NetworkHide followed by NetworkShow on the same frame works correctly (#1940)

## [1.0.0-pre.8] - 2022-04-27

### Changed

- `unmanaged` structs are no longer universally accepted as RPC parameters because some structs (i.e., structs with pointers in them, such as `NativeList<T>`) can't be supported by the default memcpy struct serializer. Structs that are intended to be serialized across the network must add `INetworkSerializeByMemcpy` to the interface list (i.e., `struct Foo : INetworkSerializeByMemcpy`). This interface is empty and just serves to mark the struct as compatible with memcpy serialization. For external structs you can't edit, you can pass them to RPCs by wrapping them in `ForceNetworkSerializeByMemcpy<T>`. (#1901)
- Changed requirement to register in-scene placed NetworkObjects with `NetworkManager` in order to respawn them.  In-scene placed NetworkObjects are now automatically tracked during runtime and no longer need to be registered as a NetworkPrefab.  (#1898)

### Removed

- Removed `SIPTransport` (#1870)
- Removed `ClientNetworkTransform` from the package samples and moved to Boss Room's Utilities package which can be found [here](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.multiplayer.samples.coop/blob/main/Packages/com.unity.multiplayer.samples.coop/Utilities/Net/ClientAuthority/ClientNetworkTransform.cs) (#1912)

### Fixed
- Fixed issue where `NetworkSceneManager` did not synchronize despawned in-scene placed NetworkObjects. (#1898)
- Fixed `NetworkTransform` generating false positive rotation delta checks when rolling over between 0 and 360 degrees. (#1890)
- Fixed client throwing an exception if it has messages in the outbound queue when processing the `NetworkEvent.Disconnect` event and is using UTP. (#1884)
- Fixed issue during client synchronization if 'ValidateSceneBeforeLoading' returned false it would halt the client synchronization process resulting in a client that was approved but not synchronized or fully connected with the server. (#1883)
- Fixed an issue where UNetTransport.StartServer would return success even if the underlying transport failed to start (#854)
- Passing generic types to RPCs no longer causes a native crash (#1901)
- Fixed a compile failure when compiling against com.unity.nuget.mono-cecil >= 1.11.4 (#1920)
- Fixed an issue where calling `Shutdown` on a `NetworkManager` that was already shut down would cause an immediate shutdown the next time it was started (basically the fix makes `Shutdown` idempotent). (#1877)

## [1.0.0-pre.7] - 2022-04-06

### Added

- Added editor only check prior to entering into play mode if the currently open and active scene is in the build list and if not displays a dialog box asking the user if they would like to automatically add it prior to entering into play mode. (#1828)
- Added `UnityTransport` implementation and `com.unity.transport` package dependency (#1823)
- Added `NetworkVariableWritePermission` to `NetworkVariableBase` and implemented `Owner` client writable netvars. (#1762)
- `UnityTransport` settings can now be set programmatically. (#1845)
- `FastBufferWriter` and Reader IsInitialized property. (#1859)
- Prefabs can now be added to the network at **runtime** (i.e., from an addressable asset). If `ForceSamePrefabs` is false, this can happen after a connection has been formed. (#1882)
- When `ForceSamePrefabs` is false, a configurable delay (default 1 second, configurable via `NetworkConfig.SpawnTimeout`) has been introduced to gracefully handle race conditions where a spawn call has been received for an object whose prefab is still being loaded. (#1882)

### Changed

- Changed `NetcodeIntegrationTestHelpers` to use `UnityTransport` (#1870)
- Updated `UnityTransport` dependency on `com.unity.transport` to 1.0.0 (#1849)

- Fixed issue where `UnityTransport` send queues were not flushed when calling `DisconnectLocalClient` or `DisconnectRemoteClient`. (#1847)
- Fixed NetworkBehaviour dependency verification check for an existing NetworkObject not searching from root parent transform relative GameObject. (#1841)
- Fixed issue where entries were not being removed from the NetworkSpawnManager.OwnershipToObjectsTable. (#1838)
- Fixed ClientRpcs would always send to all connected clients by default as opposed to only sending to the NetworkObject's Observers list by default. (#1836)
- Fixed clarity for NetworkSceneManager client side notification when it receives a scene hash value that does not exist in its local hash table. (#1828)
- Fixed client throws a key not found exception when it times out using UNet or UTP. (#1821)

- Fixed in-scene NetworkObjects get destroyed if a client fails to connect and shuts down the NetworkManager. (#1809)
- Fixed user never being notified in the editor that a NetworkBehaviour requires a NetworkObject to function properly. (#1808)
- Fixed PlayerObjects and dynamically spawned NetworkObjects not being added to the NetworkClient's OwnedObjects (#1801)
- Fixed issue where NetworkManager would continue starting even if the NetworkTransport selected failed. (#1780)
- Fixed issue when spawning new player if an already existing player exists it does not remove IsPlayer from the previous player (#1779)
- Fixed lack of notification that NetworkManager and NetworkObject cannot be added to the same GameObject with in-editor notifications (#1777)
- Fixed parenting warning printing for false positives (#1855)

## [1.0.0-pre.6] - 2022-03-02

### Added
- NetworkAnimator now properly synchrhonizes all animation layers as well as runtime-adjusted weighting between them (#1765)
- Added first set of tests for NetworkAnimator - parameter syncing, trigger set / reset, override network animator (#1735)

### Fixed
- Fixed an issue where sometimes the first client to connect to the server could see messages from the server as coming from itself. (#1683)
- Fixed an issue where clients seemed to be able to send messages to ClientId 1, but these messages would actually still go to the server (id 0) instead of that client. (#1683)
- Improved clarity of error messaging when a client attempts to send a message to a destination other than the server, which isn't allowed. (#1683)
- Disallowed async keyword in RPCs (#1681)
- Fixed an issue where Alpha release versions of Unity (version 2022.2.0a5 and later) will not compile due to the UNet Transport no longer existing (#1678)

- Fixed CheckObjectVisibility delegate not being properly invoked for connecting clients when Scene Management is enabled. (#1680)
- Fixed NetworkList to properly call INetworkSerializable's NetworkSerialize() method (#1682)
- Fixed NetworkVariables containing more than 1300 bytes of data (such as large NetworkLists) no longer cause an OverflowException (the limit on data size is now whatever limit the chosen transport imposes on fragmented NetworkDelivery mechanisms) (#1725)
- Fixed ServerRpcParams and ClientRpcParams must be the last parameter of an RPC in order to function properly. Added a compile-time check to ensure this is the case and trigger an error if they're placed elsewhere (#1721)
- Fixed FastBufferReader being created with a length of 1 if provided an input of length 0 (#1724)
- Fixed The NetworkConfig's checksum hash includes the NetworkTick so that clients with a different tickrate than the server are identified and not allowed to connect (#1728)
- Fixed OwnedObjects not being properly modified when using ChangeOwnership (#1731)
- Improved performance in NetworkAnimator (#1735)
- Removed the "always sync" network animator (aka "autosend") parameters (#1746)
- Fixed in-scene placed NetworkObjects not respawning after shutting down the NetworkManager and then starting it back up again (#1769)

## [0.1.1] - 2021-06-01

This is hotfix v0.1.1 for the initial experimental Unity MLAPI Package.

### Changed

- Fixed issue with the Unity Registry package version missing some fixes from the v0.1.0 release.

## [0.1.0] - 2021-03-23

This is the initial experimental Unity MLAPI Package, v0.1.0.

### Added

- Refactored a new standard for Remote Procedure Call (RPC) in MLAPI which provides increased performance, significantly reduced boilerplate code, and extensibility for future-proofed code. MLAPI RPC includes `ServerRpc` and `ClientRpc` to execute logic on the server and client-side. This provides a single performant unified RPC solution, replacing MLAPI Convenience and Performance RPC (see [here](#removed-features)).
- Added standarized serialization types, including built-in and custom serialization flows. See [RFC #2](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.multiplayer.rfcs/blob/master/text/0002-serializable-types.md) for details.
- `INetworkSerializable` interface replaces `IBitWritable`.
- Added `NetworkSerializer`..., which is the main aggregator that implements serialization code for built-in supported types and holds `NetworkReader` and `NetworkWriter` instances internally.
- Added a Network Update Loop infrastructure that aids Netcode systems to update (such as RPC queue and transport) outside of the standard `MonoBehaviour` event cycle. See [RFC #8](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.multiplayer.rfcs/blob/master/text/0008-network-update-loop.md) and the following details:
  - It uses Unity's [low-level Player Loop API](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/LowLevel.PlayerLoop.html) and allows for registering `INetworkUpdateSystem`s with `NetworkUpdate` methods to be executed at specific `NetworkUpdateStage`s, which may also be before or after `MonoBehaviour`-driven game logic execution.
  - You will typically interact with `NetworkUpdateLoop` for registration and `INetworkUpdateSystem` for implementation.
  - `NetworkVariable`s are now tick-based using the `NetworkTickSystem`, tracking time through network interactions and syncs.
- Added message batching to handle consecutive RPC requests sent to the same client. `RpcBatcher` sends batches based on requests from the `RpcQueueProcessing`, by batch size threshold or immediately.
- [GitHub 494](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.multiplayer.mlapi/pull/494): Added a constraint to allow one `NetworkObject` per `GameObject`, set through the `DisallowMultipleComponent` attribute.
- Integrated MLAPI with the Unity Profiler for versions 2020.2 and later:
  - Added new profiler modules for MLAPI that report important network data.
  - Attached the profiler to a remote player to view network data over the wire.
- A test project is available for building and experimenting with MLAPI features. This project is available in the MLAPI GitHub [testproject folder](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.multiplayer.mlapi/tree/release/0.1.0/testproject). 
- Added a [MLAPI Community Contributions](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/mlapi-community-contributions/tree/master/com.mlapi.contrib.extensions) new GitHub repository to accept extensions from the MLAPI community. Current extensions include moved MLAPI features for lag compensation (useful for Server Authoritative actions) and `TrackedObject`.

### Changed

- [GitHub 520](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.multiplayer.mlapi/pull/520): MLAPI now uses the Unity Package Manager for installation management.
- Added functionality and usability to `NetworkVariable`, previously called `NetworkVar`. Updates enhance options and fully replace the need for `SyncedVar`s. 
- [GitHub 507](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.multiplayer.mlapi/pull/507): Reimplemented `NetworkAnimator`, which synchronizes animation states for networked objects. 
- GitHub [444](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.multiplayer.mlapi/pull/444) and [455](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.multiplayer.mlapi/pull/455): Channels are now represented as bytes instead of strings.

For users of previous versions of MLAPI, this release renames APIs due to refactoring. All obsolete marked APIs have been removed as per [GitHub 513](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.multiplayer.mlapi/pull/513) and [GitHub 514](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.multiplayer.mlapi/pull/514).

### Fixed

- [GitHub 460](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.multiplayer.mlapi/pull/460): Fixed an issue for RPC where the host-server was not receiving RPCs from the host-client and vice versa without the loopback flag set in `NetworkingManager`. 
- Fixed an issue where data in the Profiler was incorrectly aggregated and drawn, which caused the profiler data to increment indefinitely instead of resetting each frame.
- Fixed an issue the client soft-synced causing PlayMode client-only scene transition issues, caused when running the client in the editor and the host as a release build. Users may have encountered a soft sync of `NetworkedInstanceId` issues in the `SpawnManager.ClientCollectSoftSyncSceneObjectSweep` method.
- [GitHub 458](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.multiplayer.mlapi/pull/458): Fixed serialization issues in `NetworkList` and `NetworkDictionary` when running in Server mode.
- [GitHub 498](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.multiplayer.mlapi/pull/498): Fixed numerical precision issues to prevent not a number (NaN) quaternions.
- [GitHub 438](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.multiplayer.mlapi/pull/438): Fixed booleans by reaching or writing bytes instead of bits.
- [GitHub 519](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.multiplayer.mlapi/pull/519): Fixed an issue where calling `Shutdown()` before making `NetworkManager.Singleton = null` is null on `NetworkManager.OnDestroy()`.

### Removed

With a new release of MLAPI in Unity, some features have been removed:

- SyncVars have been removed from MLAPI. Use `NetworkVariable`s in place of this functionality. <!-- MTT54 -->
- [GitHub 527](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.multiplayer.mlapi/pull/527): Lag compensation systems and `TrackedObject` have moved to the new [MLAPI Community Contributions](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/mlapi-community-contributions/tree/master/com.mlapi.contrib.extensions) repo.
- [GitHub 509](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.multiplayer.mlapi/pull/509): Encryption has been removed from MLAPI. The `Encryption` option in `NetworkConfig` on the `NetworkingManager` is not available in this release. This change will not block game creation or running. A current replacement for this functionality is not available, and may be developed in future releases. See the following changes:
    - Removed `SecuritySendFlags` from all APIs.
    - Removed encryption, cryptography, and certificate configurations from APIs including `NetworkManager` and `NetworkConfig`.
    - Removed "hail handshake", including `NetworkManager` implementation and `NetworkConstants` entries.
    - Modified `RpcQueue` and `RpcBatcher` internals to remove encryption and authentication from reading and writing.
- Removed the previous MLAPI Profiler editor window from Unity versions 2020.2 and later.
- Removed previous MLAPI Convenience and Performance RPC APIs with the new standard RPC API. See [RFC #1](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.multiplayer.rfcs/blob/master/text/0001-std-rpc-api.md) for details.
- [GitHub 520](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.multiplayer.mlapi/pull/520): Removed the MLAPI Installer.

### Known Issues

- `NetworkNavMeshAgent` does not synchronize mesh data, Agent Size, Steering, Obstacle Avoidance, or Path Finding settings. It only synchronizes the destination and velocity, not the path to the destination.
- For `RPC`, methods with a `ClientRpc` or `ServerRpc` suffix which are not marked with [ServerRpc] or [ClientRpc] will cause a compiler error.
- For `NetworkAnimator`, Animator Overrides are not supported. Triggers do not work.
- For `NetworkVariable`, the `NetworkDictionary` `List` and `Set` must use the `reliableSequenced` channel.
- `NetworkObjects`s are supported but when spawning a prefab with nested child network objects you have to manually call spawn on them
- `NetworkTransform` have the following issues:
  - Replicated objects may have jitter. 
  - The owner is always authoritative about the object's position.
  - Scale is not synchronized.
- Connection Approval is not called on the host client.
- For `NamedMessages`, always use `NetworkBuffer` as the underlying stream for sending named and unnamed messages.
- For `NetworkManager`, connection management is limited. Use `IsServer`, `IsClient`, `IsConnectedClient`, or other code to check if MLAPI connected correctly.
